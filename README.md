# Low Code AI Starter Kit

## Overview

This repository provides a low code AI starter kit for developers to quickly get started with building AI applications using various tools and technologies. It includes pre-configured Docker compose files for popular AI frameworks and libraries, as well as references to code and documentation to help you get up and running quickly.

### Core Idea

The core idea behind this starter kit is to provide an opinionated but differentiated set of tools and technologies that can be used to build AI applications quickly and easily. By leveraging the power of Docker compose files, developers can quickly spin up and configure popular low code and AI frameworks with the flexibility to add their own code as needed.

### Technologies

- Supabase (for authentication and data storage)
- LiteLLM (for low code AI proxying across various services)
- n8n (for workflow automation)
- Dify (for conversational AI workflows)
- RedwoodJS (for full stack web development)
- Caddy (for web server)
- Appsmith (for low code web development)
